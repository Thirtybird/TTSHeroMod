1. Download Atom.                
   https://atom.io/
2. Install TTS Plug-in for Atom. 
   https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/atom/
   *** Note ***
   If you get errors similar to "npm ERR! code UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY", try turning off your VPN and / or disabling your firewall temporarily.
3. Clone the TTSHeroMod github.
   a. Navigate to https://github.com/Thirtybird/TTSHeroMod
   b. Click the green Code dropdown.
   c. If you don't use GitHub or SVN, download the ZIP and extract to a local directory of your preference.
4. Configure TTS integration for Atom:
   a. Navigate to File->Settings->Packages
   b. Click the "settings" button in the "tabletopsimulator-lua" tab
   c. Set the "Base path for files you wish to bundle or #Include" to the local directory from step 3c.
   
Gobal.ttslua should only have one line in it
#include !/HeroMod/heromod

Similarly, the Dicerollers and the SceneBuilder only have one line also
#include !/DiceRoller/diceroller
#include !/SceneBuilder/scenebuilder

Atom will grab the files from the corresponding directory and unpack them into the object when sending it to TTS
