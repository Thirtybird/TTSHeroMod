install tts integration for atom
File->Settings->Packages
Click the "settings" button in the "tabletopsimulator-lua" tab
Set the "Base path for files you wish to bundle or #Include" to the Local Github clone directory

Gobal.ttslua should only have one line in it
#include !/HeroMod/heromod

Similarly, the Dicerollers and the SceneBuilder only have one line also
#include !/DiceRoller/diceroller
#include !/SceneBuilder/scenebuilder

Atom will grab the files from the corresponding directory and unpack them into the object when sending it to TTS
