   *** Note
   If you get errors similar to "npm ERR! code UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY", try turning off your VPN and / or disabling your firewall temproraily.
3. Configure TTS integration for Atom:
   a. Navigate to File->Settings->Packages
   b. Click the "settings" button in the "tabletopsimulator-lua" tab
   c. Set the "Base path for files you wish to bundle or #Include" to the Local Github clone directory

Gobal.ttslua should only have one line in it
#include !/HeroMod/heromod

Similarly, the Dicerollers and the SceneBuilder only have one line also
#include !/DiceRoller/diceroller
#include !/SceneBuilder/scenebuilder

Atom will grab the files from the corresponding directory and unpack them into the object when sending it to TTS
